# MagicTime-Game
## A 2D adventure game based on Node.js/Express.js, React for client side, and Firebase as a database

The base mechanics of this game revolves around the typical 2D adventure/rpg game with a twist based on Age as a resource mechanic.

The client should feature a login/sign-up, main screen which allows for settings(profile and options), in-game screen, additionally should allow for instanteous save-states in the case the browser window is closed for whatever reason.

The server should allow for REST api calls from the frontend, and allow for resource calling to Google Cloud/Firebase. The server will handle all in-game logic again via REST calls.

The project can be followed via Trello, and internally via ZenHub.

## Additional information / screens should be provided below.
